                <p class="my-4">
                    LM&dash;Sounds a DJ from Herentals wanted a new and updated website. The previous one was made in
                    wix and really needed to updated. Lander, a friend of mine, is the idea behind LM&dash;Sounds. The
                    group plays at weddings, business and birthday parties.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    When we were chatting, we suddenly came to the subject websites. After a while Lander said he needed
                    a new website. Because I was immediately interested I started to ask questions and before we knew he
                    had explained me the whole idea of their site. A few days later I had made a sketch and sent it to
                    him to check and get feedback.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 md:mb-0">
                    The next step was developing the website with my other Maxim. First thing was getting the
                    basics, what really had to be integrated into the website and what could be nice to have but not
                    necessary. We always tried to keep Lander informed on our progress.

                <p class="my-4">
                    What I learned is: communicating to your customer (in this case a friend). Lander did not have much
                    knowledge so if you need to explain something, you had to be sure that he would understand it. Also
                    keeping the client up to date is nice. That way he knows if you are making progress and just have
                    almost instant feedback.
                </p>
                <p class="my-4">
                    While creating the website I mostly focused on the content and what elements should be on the
                    website or not. Maxim focused on the styling of the site. Of course Lander had the final word, and
                    every big decision was only made when he agreed with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed this project, not only to create a website but also to help a friend and support
                    him in the long run. We also keep the website up to date and try to make sure the hosting is always
                    online.
                </p>
