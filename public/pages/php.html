                    This is the follow up project of Requirement Analysis (RA). Now it was time to use our practical
                    skills
                    and turn the theory into a web application for a client. We weren't allowed to use our own RA
                    project
                    but we had use the documentary from another group. This way we learn both ways, the setup and the
                    practical. This project was the first where I didn't made something for myself.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 md:mb-0">
                    In this project we used Jira, a project management tool, Laravel, a PHP framework, Bootstrap, a css
                    framework and AJAX, a set of web development techniques. With Jira we could easily keep an eye on
                    what tasks were already completed, tasks we had to complete or who was working on what usecase.
                    We used Laravel to create fast, quickly and simple webpages. To give everything a nice look
                    Bootstrap was the answer.

                <p class="my-4">
                    What I learned during this project is: communicating to our colleagues and to a client. If you can't
                    make yourself clear, others won't we able to help you. Also, if your client doesn't understand you
                    and vice versa the web application will not be at its full potential. Another thing I learned is to
                    ask for help. We are learning and we don't know everything about PHP, Laravel or AJAX. During this
                    project I created: the login, the student and docent pages and I took most of the styling on me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall I really liked this project. It was a really good teaser of what programming really is.
                    Of course it had its ups and downs but thanks to this project I learned things I never knew before.
                    Not only my hard skills but also my soft skills definitely had a boost.
